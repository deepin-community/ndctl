Unit tests
==========

The package build attempts to run the unit tests, but they require a specially
built kernel and kernel module and will be skipped. See README.md for details.

Since they do not fail and are just (correctly) skipped, dh_auto_test is not
being overriden in d/rules. Future releases might have other tests that do not
require a special environment.
