Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Description: Utility for managing the nvdimm subsystem
 The nvdimm subsystem defines a kernel device model and control message
 interface for platform NVDIMM resources like those defined by the ACPI 6+ NFIT
 (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table).
 .
 This package contains a utility for managing the nvdimm (non-volatile memory
 device) subsystem in the Linux kernel.

Description: Utility library for managing the libnvdimm subsystem
 The nvdimm subsystem defines a kernel device model and control message
 interface for platform NVDIMM resources like those defined by the ACPI 6+ NFIT
 (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table).

Description: Utility for managing the device DAX subsystem
 "DAX" are file system extensions to bypass the page cache and block layer to
 mmap persistent memory, from a PMEM block device, directly into a process
 address space.
