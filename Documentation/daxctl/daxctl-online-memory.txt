=======================

NAME
----
daxctl-online-memory - Online the memory for a device that is in system-ram mode

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'daxctl online-memory' <dax0.0> [<dax1.0>...<daxY.Z>] [<options>]

EXAMPLES
--------

* Reconfigure dax0.0 to system-ram mode, don't online the memory
----
# daxctl reconfigure-device --mode=system-ram --no-online --human dax0.0
{
  "chardev":"dax0.0",
  "size":"7.87 GiB (8.45 GB)",
  "target_node":2,
  "mode":"system-ram"
}
----

* Online the memory separately
----
# daxctl online-memory dax0.0
dax0.0: 62 new sections onlined
onlined memory for 1 device
----

* Onlining memory when some sections were already online
----
# daxctl online-memory dax0.0
dax0.0: 1 section already online
dax0.0: 61 new sections onlined
onlined memory for 1 device
----

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Online the memory sections associated with a device that has been converted
to the system-ram mode. If one or more blocks are already online, print a
message about them, and attempt to online the remaining blocks.

This is complementary to the 'daxctl-reconfigure-device' command, when used with
the '--no-online' option to skip onlining memory sections immediately after the
reconfigure. In these scenarios, the memory can be onlined at a later time using
'daxctl-online-memory'.

OPTIONS
-------
-r::
--region=::
	Restrict the operation to devices belonging to the specified region(s).
	A device-dax region is a contiguous range of memory that hosts one or
	more /dev/daxX.Y devices, where X is the region id and Y is the device
	instance id.

-u::
--human::
	By default the command will output machine-friendly raw-integer
	data. Instead, with this flag, numbers representing storage size
	will be formatted as human readable strings with units, other
	fields are converted to hexadecimal strings.

-v::
--verbose::
	Emit more debug messages
